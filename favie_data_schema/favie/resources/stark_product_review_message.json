I was incredibly excited about this product because it contained “retinal” and the price was very affordable.

A review i read said this was normal for it to peel and the directions say it’s safe to use every night. I continued to use for 2 more nights. It was very harsh and damaging to my skin. I stoped using completely because my skin was hurting, irritating, broken out and patchy. I’m not the type to have sensitive skin. I would consider myself to have more dry skin than oily but i have never had my skin react like it did when trying this product. I have tan skin, it’s going to take me months to recover from the scars this has caused me.",
